# E12 NBA-predictor 

Authors: Hendrik Saliste, Gert Kalmus, Karl Aleksander Kaplinski

## Goal
The goal of the project was to predict the 2023/24 NBA season using data from the previous season.
We chose this idea because sport prediction has always seemed like an interesting and hard to implement. This project furthered our understanding in both data science and NBA.

## REPO CONTENTS:
* old_files - old data and python files, not used anymore
* original_data - the original data files used for the project
* working_version - the current python and data files that run the model
* results - contains the final excel file with the results

## USING THE MODEL:
1. download the working_version folder
2. run the projekt.py file - creates the prediciton for the 2023/24 season
3. run the result.py file - creates the final results excel file by combining actual and predicted results
